# P2P-LendingClub-prediction-on-trustworth-future-clients
We will use the Lending Club P2P database taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club (but modified in order to make some more feature engineering). Given historical data along with the outcome of the borrower (default? debt payed?) we want to build a ANN model that predict the behaviour of a future borrower based off the given features. In this way the company can assess if a potential customer is likely to pay back the loan or not and maybe update thereafter the interest rate, for example. Before building the model I proceed with a quite accurate data analysis and feature engineering.
